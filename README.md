# BlueMap Floodgate
A Minecraft Paper plugin and [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap) addon that adds https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate support

You can safely reload the config by reloading this plugin with [PlugManX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plugmanx.88135/).\
(I do not recommend using it for other plugins! Plugin reloaders like this can seriously mess up some plugins)

[Camotoy](https://github.com/Camotoy/GeyserSkinManager) for their open-source plugins that gave me great examples to learn from.\
And [TBlueF](https://github.com/TBlueF) of course for his amazing plugin and fast support with my silly questions!
