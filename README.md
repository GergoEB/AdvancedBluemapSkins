# Modified fork of [Technic Jelle's "Floodgate](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapFloodgate)

This plugins aims to allow more advanced configuration of floodgate skin loading in BlueMap.

With this plugin, you can use different skin APIs for floodgate players and normal Java players.
This is different from TechnicJelle's plugin, because that one is not configurable at all, and just uses unconfigurable APIs for everything.

# Support

Ask in official Bluemap Discord, you can mention me (Semetrix#5115) if you need help

# Todo:
- [Skinsrestorer support instead of custom link](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX/blob/dev/api/src/main/java/net/skinsrestorer/api/SkinsRestorerAPI.java)
