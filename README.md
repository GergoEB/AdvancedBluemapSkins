# BlueMap Floodgate
A Minecraft Paper plugin and [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap) addon that adds https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate support

You can safely reload the config by reloading this plugin with [PlugManX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plugmanx.88135/).\
(I do not recommend using it for other plugins! Plugin reloaders like this can seriously mess up some plugins)

### Config
- `verboseUpdateMessages: true`
  - Set to `true` you want more messages telling you what the plugin is up to.

- `cacheHours: 72`
  - How long to keep the playerheads cached for. The lower this number, the faster skin updates will appear, but the more network usage there will be.
