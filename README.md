# Modified fork of [Technic Jelle's "Floodgate](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapFloodgate)

This plugin aims to allow more advanced configuration of skin loading in Bluemap

It can use 2 different APIs for getting the skins, 1 is for floodgate players, and the other for anything else (Java players). 

This is a changed version of Technic Jelle's plugin since it doesnt just fallback to default BlueMap skin API when the player is question is not a floodgate player

# Todo:
- [Skinsrestorer support instead of custom link](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX/blob/dev/api/src/main/java/net/skinsrestorer/api/SkinsRestorerAPI.java)
